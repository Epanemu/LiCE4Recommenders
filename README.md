# Plausible Counterfactual Explanations or Recommenders

This is a repository with a modified implementation of LiCE, for Recommender Systems. The paper is submitted and not yet publicly accessible online.

To replicate the results, install `requirements.txt`, download the datasets (only amazon data is available via an API) and then the commands in the `full_process.sh` file. Note that this takes long and requires a lot of memory (up to 128GB).

To compute the tables in the paper, browse the jupyter notebook `4_evaluate.ipynb`.

We only include results on the publicly available datasets.
