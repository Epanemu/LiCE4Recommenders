This is a repository with a modified implementation of LiCE for Recommender Systems. The preprint is accessible at [link to be added]()

To replicate the results, install `requirements.txt`, download the datasets (only Amazon data is available via an API), and then run the commands in the `full_process.sh` file. Note that this takes a long time and requires a lot of memory (up to 128GB).

To compute the tables in the paper, browse the Jupyter notebook `4_evaluate.ipynb`.

We only include results on the publicly available datasets.
